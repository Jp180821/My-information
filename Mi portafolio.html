      <p>Hi everyone, my real name is Jesus Peña and I'm from Mexico, and let me talk to you how a finish my days working as developer:
        <br>
    when a I was 29 years old, my roomate Abraham was a full stack developer, and always when we were in his room watching tv, or listen music, he always
    told me something. Yisus learn programming!!!
    <br>
    I always want to be a developer but never start learn how to come, on that moment I was working in a big company, it was a Polaris Company,
    <br> I guess everyone knows that company, they make a Razer cars, they are so famouse and expansives, But on that days someting does not have complety me happy, 
    <br> and one morning  I wake up and I acept to watach a little bit python, and surprise, I spent all my day watching videos, reading blogs, making examples, and I said this it is I looking for a years.

    <br>he dowland a lot courses and activities for me, I remember when a told my grilfrend:
    <br> Honey I'm going to learn a lot programming, and she said just one thing:
    <br> If you switch your experience from mechanical engienner to developer, I need just one thing, become to the best developer on your field.
    <br> and I swear guys, I feel so comfortable with that words than a spent a lot time learning leanguages.
